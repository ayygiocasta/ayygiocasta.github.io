	Ho-Kago Tea Time - Don't Say "Lazy"<br><br>
	There's not much to say, I just felt like recording something, but I couldn't be arsed to learn a new song from scratch, 
	or waste all day playing something over and over until I get a clean take, so I just went for something really short and easy that I already
	knew how to play, in fact I'm almost sure this is the very first song I learned how to play from start to finish.<br>

	Lily White - 微熱からMystery<br><br>
	It's not perfect, but it's my first attempt at recording something and I think it turned out ok.<br>
	A couple of notes here and there are slightly off-time, but I didn't bother fixing them since originally I wasn't planning on publishing this.<br>
