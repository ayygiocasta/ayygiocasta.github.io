					<text style="color:#ff0088">Mori x Gura - KING</text><br><br>
					My first attempt at double tracking, I think it sounds better than anything I've posted up until now.
					I really need to find a way to make the lead stick out in the mix, I tried messing with the EQ, but clearly
					it wasn't enough.

					I tried some EQ/compression/volume shenanigas, but it still ended up sounding cluttered and muddy, especially in the parts
					where both guitars are playing. It's far from perfect and way out of my league, but it's one of my favorite songs to play regardless.
					I definitely need to learn more about mixing...

				<text style="color:#ff0088">JAM Project - 未来への咆哮 / Asu e no Houkou<br>(Muv-Luv Alternative OP)</text><br><br>
				Since the original guitar parts were obviously written to provide a rhythmic/harmonic bed for the vocals, I changed
				a few parts to sound better in a mix where the guitar is so loud compared to everything else, just a couple of 
				arpeggios and flat 5 dyads and the second half of the chorus. This was my first time recording with the GT-1000, it sounds good, I think.

		<h2>20 May 2021</h2>
				<p align="center">
				<text style="color:#ff0088">Hololive EN - Country Roads</text><br><br>
				Since the whole song is basically the same two chord progressions repeated over and over I tried to spice it up a bit 
				by adding a short solo and playing around with the arpeggios. Listening to it again i think it sounds boring and uninspired,
				but I had fun playing it so I decided to upload it anyway. This was also my first time strumming without a pick, not a pleasant
				experience, I have no idea how people do that like its nothing...<br><br>

					<text style="color:#ff0088">Ho-Kago Tea Time - Don't Say "Lazy"</text><br><br>
					There's not much to say, I just felt like recording something, but I couldn't be arsed to learn a new song from scratch, 
					or waste all day playing something over and over until I get a clean take, so I just went for something really short and easy 
					that I already knew how to play, in fact I'm almost sure this is the very first song I learned to play from start to finish.<br>

					<p align="center">
					<text style="color:#ff0088">Lily White - 微熱からMystery</text><br><br>
					It's not perfect, but it's my first attempt at recording something and I think it turned out ok.<br>
					A couple of notes here and there are slightly off-time, but I didn't bother fixing them since originally 
					I wasn't planning on publishing this.<br>
