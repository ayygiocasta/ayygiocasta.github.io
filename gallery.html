	<p>
	I recently started drawing, and I obviously draw anime shit because I'm a disgusting weeb degenerate.<br>
	To be completely honest I'm not particularly passionate about it. I started drawing because I have like four graphic tablets laying around and it was kind of a waste to
	only use them as gayming peripherials.<br>
	Click to enlarge (note that I didn't bother resizing them so they go up to like 6k~ pixels).<br><br>
	</p>
	<p style="color:#ff0088">Also, I know this kind of layout is absolutely sub-optimal for browsing pictures, 
	but I'd rather have this than make an interactive gallery with j***script, sorry.</p>

	Flustered Tsubaki (Arakure Ojousama wa Monmon Shiteiru).<br>
	Considering it's my first time taking my time to actually finish something I start I'm rather happy with how it turned out.<br><br>
