	<h1>Gallery</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
	I recently started drawing, and obviously I draw anime shit because I'm a disgusting degenerate weeb.<br>
	To be completely honest I'm not particularly passionate about it. I started drawing because I have like four graphic tablets laying around and it was kind of a waste to
	use them only as gayming peripherials.<br>
	Click to enlarge (note that I didn't bother resizing them so they go up to like 6k~ pixels).<br><br>
	</p>
	<p style="color:#ff0088">Also, I know this kind of layout is absolutely sub-optimal for browsing pictures, 
	but I'd rather use this than an interactive gallery built with j***script, sorry.</p>

	I had the opportunity to get my hands on a big ass tablet with a display (for free :^) ) and this is the result.<br>
	I didn't really feel like drawing and I'm quite busy these days, so I tried to recall from memory a fanart 
	(actually I'm not even sure it was fanmade, it could've been official) of Kobaryo's mascot a saw a while ago.<br>
	I was in such a hurry that I didn't even use any kind of reference (and it shows), but I'm relatively happy with how it turned out.<br>
	Oh, I also bought a Clip Studio Licence, so this was also my first time trying it out. I'd say it's pretty comfy, even though I'm still used to Medibang's shortcuts.<br><br>

	Tanned DEKAI tomboy. It's all fun ang games until you get to the wrinkles on the shirt, fuck that shit.<br>
	It's been more than two months since the last post, I've been really busy and it's only gonna get worse so I'm probably not gonna draw anything for a while.<br><br>

	Chie-chan from 妹の友達が何考えてるのかわからない, straight from the pool chapter.<br>
	Fun shit, went through four Nanahira albums in the process, denpa is probably the most fitting BGM when drawing lolis.<br><br>

	Some random YARIMAN, ispired by one of Satou Kuuki's doujins.<br>
	Trying to draw a passably reastic shadow under the boobs gave me a fucking headache.<br><br>

	Reina from Hibike! Euphonium. Inspired by one of Takeda Hiromitsu's doujins.<br>

	Flustered Tsubaki (Arakure Ojousama wa Monmon Shiteiru).<br>
	Considering it's my first time taking my time to actually finish something I start I'm rather happy with how it turned out.<br><br>
